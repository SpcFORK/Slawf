# Slawf
Multi-Layered UWF HVM Ontop Tacit Langauge.

# Goals
- [ ] Hypervisor
  - [ ] VM suite
    - [ ] VMs may interface eachother using Hypervisor instance
    - [ ] VMs may make instances of VMs
    - [ ] VMs may instance sub-visors
  - [ ] Threading where possible and or Fake Threading for environments unable

- [ ] Upgraded version of Oakl setups
  - [ ] Either...
    - [ ] Better Web-Interop that does not conflict?
    - [ ] Slawf Web Interop
       
- [ ] More modules
  - [ ] Oak-JS interop suite
    - [ ] Abstraction Redundance swap-in for core JS functions to shorten code
      - (Instead of std.each, asks if interopping, if so, use core functions instead of unwrapped abstractions)
  - [ ] Inklang's BMP image module
  - [ ] Better Crypto.oak
    - [ ] Base* coding suite
    - [ ] Parity check suite
  - [ ] Compression suite!
  - [ ] Bitwise suite!

- [ ] Transpile to Oak AST
  - [ ] Transpile to Oak
- [ ] Broader evaluation setup
  - [ ] Standardized Binary forms
    - [ ] More than ELF?
    - [ ] ARM?
    - [ ] Oak Bytecode instead of only ELF (requires engine)?

- [ ] Bootstrap..?
  - ...If binary size does not grow larger than non-strapped version
